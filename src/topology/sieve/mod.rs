//! Sieve module: provides the core [`Sieve`] trait and implementations for in-memory, strata, and arc payload sieves.
//!
//! This module defines the main interface for sieve data structures, which are used for efficient set membership queries.
//! It also provides several implementations, including an in-memory version and others for specialized use cases.

/// Core trait for sieve data structures.

/// Strata sieve implementation.
pub mod strata;
/// Sieve implementation using arc payloads.
pub mod arc_payload;

// Re-export the core trait and in‚Äêmemory impl at top level
